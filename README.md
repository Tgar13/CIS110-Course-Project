# CIS110-Course-Project
For CIS 110 Computer Programming Design, this assignment was required. 
It's a special kind of Mad Libs that tells the tale of a dog. 
The user is requested to choose the dog's breed, name, and other crucial details. 
The narrative has four potential conclusions built in. Each choice that the user is given is based on "Yes" or "No."
It was essential to provide an alternative conclusion for each choice in order to cover allÂ possibilities.

How Code Works/Lessons Learned:
Indentation errors were one of the most difficult aspects of this project. The absence of tabs and/or whitespaces between lines of code is an indentation fault. 
Because Python is a procedural language, if you forget to include tabs or spaces between your lines of code, you will almost certainly get this error. 
Although in some circumstances the entire program will execute without errors, in others the error will occur in the middle of the execution, causing the entire operation to be paused. 
In my case, my code kept looping to identifying a dog breed type. This was frustrating because my code had all the correct components. To troubleshoot this issue, I went through each line and redid the indentations. 
This was quite tedious but all lines of code in Python are organized into blocks, making it easier to discover errors. 
Overall, this course taught me the fundamentals of coding. I've put it to practice in my daily work and have learned to pay attention to the small aspects, such as formatting. 

Thank you!
